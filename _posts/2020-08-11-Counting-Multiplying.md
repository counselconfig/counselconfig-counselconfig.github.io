How does one count? Something as simple as counting, which we do by rote memory, seems to demand suprisingly large amounts of labour. Working this out, first the four properties of an algorithm i.e. 

1. _Unique initialisation_
2. _Unique succession_
3. _Finiteness_
4. _Solution_

can be appplied to write how to count, as least from the point of view of a computer:

I find it easier and shorter to write an algorithm for multiplication. Bearing in mind, computers pretend to multiply by still adding numbers, but just in loops Ã  la below.

Here is a trace of the TIMES alogrithm of the values _prod_ and _u_ everytime it enters the **_repeat...endrepeat_** construct:


| _prod_   | 0 | 13 | 26 | 39 | 52  | 65  |
| _u_      | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3   | 4   | 5   |

The notion here is that the algorithm multiplies x = 5 by y =13.
