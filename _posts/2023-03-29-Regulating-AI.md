# Regulating AI

The British government has just released its <b>AI regulation: a pro-innovation approach</b> policy paper which you can view <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1146542/a_pro-innovation_approach_to_AI_regulation.pdf">here</a>.   The white paper details plans for enabling innovation to AI regulation and seeks views through a supporting consultation. It comes at a time today where over 1,000 people including Elon Musk are calling for an "immediate pause" on the creation of “giant” AIs for a minumum six months to study the dangers of systems such as the next <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">Generative Pre-trained Transformer</a>.

The relationship between emerging technology and regulation is widley debated, particularly in the field of augemnted humans which I wrote an IEEE article about recently below.
