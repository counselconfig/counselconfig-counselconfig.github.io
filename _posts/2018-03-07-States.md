Constraints in the use case are derived from non-functional requirements vis-à-vis common dental operations. In particular, recorded information about a Patient must be saved. This ruleis elicited from Standards for the Dental Team 4.1 (General Dental Council, 2014 [^fn1]). The second constraint, that Patient records must be accessible and kept securely for a maximum 30 years on retention, is partly legislative. The legal parts of this constraint would be retrievable storage of commissioning emails saved to the server via, say, a JavaMail API. The UML standard does allows for Object Constraint Language to supplement models (Object Management Group, 2006[^fn2]). Thus ‘a commissioning email can be stored 30 years minimum can be added as a note that:

`Context Email inv: self.years->size()>=30`

A Patient `class` could have a modifier that allows visibility for classes only contained within its package to call the fetchEmail method which reduces the extendibility needed for General_administrator.

However, time is not statutory since Schedule 1 Data Protection Act (DPA (2008))[^fn4] gives no definite scale, leaving the NHS to provide the said years (Information Governance Alliance, 2016[^fn5]). On the other hand, security of information and access is from the DPA, which constrains a nested email to the binary ‘state’ of being Saved to the server.

```java
class Email {
    private boolean saved;
    private void storeEmail() {
    saved=true;
    }
    Private void Remove() {
    saved=false;
    }
}
```
