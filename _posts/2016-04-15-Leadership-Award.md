HMT currently hosts Intranet sites on SharePoint 2013 using customised CSS, Jscript, and Master Pages based on templates. However, SharePoint online has now rolled out more user centric comms site templates tailored for intranet info portals, rather than Teams, which should be easier to meet requirements. I have been working with Corporate Services to Improve collaboration internally within HMT to replace the current on premises SharePoint 2013 environment with the SharePoint online environment to reduce licensing cost and technical footprint within on-premises data centres. KM helps to achieve these goals along with reducing the dependency on email for sharing of data and documentation.
