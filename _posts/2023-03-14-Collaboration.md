I want to share the ways I work in multidisciplinary teams using agile methodologies throuh project managment software - Trello, Azure DevOps, and Altlassian

### Trello

I often propose the web-based, kanban-style Trello with my mentees so they can create their task boards with different columns and move the tasks between them.

}
</style>

Typically columns include task statuses such as To Do, In Progress, Done which allows me to review each stage and comment where necessary:

### Azure DevOps

Some teams I have worked with agreed to use Azure DevOps (a server collaboration software for software development formerly known as Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Team System). It has a Azure Boards which helps to deliver value to  users faster using proven agile tools to plan, track, and discuss work.

It also has a sprint interface:

### Jira

Jira, developed by Atlassian, is another platform I have used - like those above, it is a proprietary issue tracking product that allows bug tracking and agile project management.
