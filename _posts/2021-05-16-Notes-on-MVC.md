The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a well known software pattern - I have drawn the activity of how it works in an ASP.NET Framework context below:

MVC can be acheived with ASP.NET Core to partition the required layers (Troelsen & Japikse, 2020)[^fn1]. The MVC handles the bidirectional communications with a user of a graphical interface via a ‘controller’. The controller is a broker in the business layer to handle input for a ‘model’ at the data layer behaving as the state for a rendered ‘view’ at the presentation layer (Parson, 2020). Because an MVC derives from O-O programming (Thakur & Pandey, 2019)[^fn2], it also made a suitable ASP.NET Core architecture for object creation, following Figure 2.

This model was a real product I developed for an online hardware shop, note that tiers are not synonymous with layers. They are both architectures typically divided thrice, but the former relates to the physical deployment and the latter to the repository structure (Esposito & Saltarello, 2014)[^fn5]. MVC initiation can be found in the `startup.cs` public class method `services.AddControllersWithViews();`. This brings into effect the layers: `Controllers`, `View`, `ViewModels`, and `Models`. The decision to have a viewmodel was created as a way to contain listed transitory categorised hardware data that could be constructed in a `HardwareController` first and then passed to the `HardwareListViewModel` at the presentation layer:

```c#
namespace MVC_DL.ViewModels
{
    public class HardwareListViewModel
    {
        public IEnumerable<Hardware> Hardwares { get; set; }
        public string CurrentCategory { get; set; }
    }
}
```
This is an architecture often associated with Model-View-ViewModel scaffolding where `ViewModel` represents the `View` state with changeable data (Kouraklis, 2016)[^fn6].
