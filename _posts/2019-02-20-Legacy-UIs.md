Entity life history are dialogue diagrams that were used in the 1980's which I think are tremendously useful for modeling the logic of user interface (UI) interaction. 

# 4.1 AHC dialogue structure diagram

## 4.1.1 Function definition

A set of SSADM factored elementary processes descriptions based on (Appendix) (1.1.1…1.1.4) constitute a class of function that triggers an update to system survey report data with a Manager’s cottage appraisal.


## 4.1.2 User interface (UI) specification

Based on its function definition I produce an input/output (I/O) description for ‘Process appraisal’ containing data items that make up the final output dialogue.
