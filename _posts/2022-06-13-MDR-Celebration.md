I lead the data integration developemnt project for the UK online Manorial Documents Register (MDR) application, and attended a private reception at the Royal Courts of Justice to mark its completion today, along with 100 years of the Law of Propety Act 1925. 

The MDR is an index of English and Welsh manorial records, providing brief descriptions of documents and details of their locations in public and private hands. Here's a link to the developed register application
