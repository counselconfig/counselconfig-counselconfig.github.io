### Letter of No Evidence

A webform I am developing that implememts the GOV.UK Pay API which will soon replace the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/contact-us/request-a-letter-confirming-no-evidence-of-british-naturalisation/form/">Request a search for no evidence of British naturalisation</a>.

The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/api_reference/#api-reference">GOV.UK Pay API</a> documentation is helpful, if you create an account it comes with a sandbox testing environment.    

The iniitial develpment had one step:

<video loop="true" muted autoplay controls>
    <source src="/assets/videos/lone_prototype.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Lately, after further meetings with the asset owner, it was agreed to add more multi-steps to shorten the the amount of information.

<video loop="true" muted autoplay controls>
    <source src="/assets/videos/lonesavecomplete.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Ideally, I will be looking to make it [GDS Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice) compliant
