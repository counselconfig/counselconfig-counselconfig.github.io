I have been working with developers on a CRM system called Dynamics 365 to implement The National Archives' first <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/legal/takedown-and-reclosure-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take Down Panel</a> management system.

To get the system working in accordance with the policy, I first wrote these use cases

These use case descriptions then formed the basis for me to create a takedown panel activity diagram 


<embed src="/assets/images/tdp.svg" width="100%" height="100%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto">


Thereafter, the activity process was developed into this Dynamics 365 case workflow strip:


<style>
object {
  border: 1px solid #555;
}
</style>

I then got staff end-users to test a bundle of scripts that I wrote for user acceptance testing:
